The secret of this challenge comes from the fact that the flag already exists in the executable, but in a transformed state. We could theoritically wait for the program itself to "un-transform" the flag and spit it out, but from reading the decompiled code, we can see that it is designed to be as slow as possible, which would result in us waiting millions of years. There are many ways one could approach this problem, but the simplest one is to simply extract the transformed flag out of the executable and performing the transformation ourselves.

First, let's take a look at the decompiled code. Now, we could just use `objdump` and read the Assembly directly, but personally, I found that a little bit too disorienting, so instead, I used Ghidra's decompiler to see the source code of the main function.
